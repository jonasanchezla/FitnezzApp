A small fitness app where you can choose what program/workout you want to focus on a certain day. Each workout will have instructions on how to do them. After signing up and logging in, the user will have the option to choose what muscle group, or day they want to focus on. If certain exercises cant be met, you will have the option to change and customize your program yourself. Meal plans will also be included to help people get started on the right track.
